# This project is made for DSC club inductions:
**Made by**- Divya Manas Shahi
**Tech stacks used -**
Atom:For writing all my code
HTML
CSS
BOOTSTRAP
Git hub for deploying my website
**Source of learning :** Angela Yu's Course on Udemy
My site Includes 3 main pages for this project

1.> **Home Page**
One of the key feature of this home page is that it is responsive on all devices and should work on both tablets annd mobile phones as well
The Heading AMBROSIA means food of gods in greek and roman mythology
The font family used is 'comforter'
I have also used carosuel for the trending page along with silde buttons 
I have also changed the colour of "previous" "next" buttons from their default(white) to black.
The next thing i added was the menu section in which i used bootstrap card for arranging them in order 
i also used the row and column features so that i can make my site properly visible on all devices 
I have use **PSEUDO CLASSES** in cards where i added animation in which the cards get bigger than its size when we hover our mouse over them.
 I have also linked those cards to other famous sites as well(not made by me ) just for fun!!
The last section is of description where we can find our social media profiles by clicking on the icons 
  i have used pseudo class on those icons as well where they get enlarge when we hover over them.
  I have also added  a sponsordhip section  and few images  as well.
 Navigation bar is also used (i took a simple format from bootstrap) i have anchored all the things in the navigation bar to a certain location .
 However the search bar is not completely functional as i didnt learnt javascript that well during the given time.
 navigation bar is available and functional on all the three pages .
 
 2.> **Gold membership page:**
For this page i have used bootstrap cards and edited them according to my needs 
I have also ensured that these cards are responsive on all devices 

3.> **Login Page**
I have changed many css lines and html of the login page , however most o fit is taken form bootsrtap 
i have also changed the background image  of the login page to make ot relatable to website 
pass word section has input type of pass word thats why it shows dots when we type something.
